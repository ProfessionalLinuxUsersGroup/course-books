# Unit 7 - Package Management & Patching

## Overview

Managing software on a Linux system involves two essential practices: package management and patching. Together, they ensure that systems remain functional, up-to-date, and secure by handling software installation, updates, and vulnerability remediation. 

- **Package Management:** the system used to install, upgrade, configure, and remove software packages while automatically resolving dependencies and maintaining system consistency.

- **Patching:** the process of applying updates to software packages or the kernel to fix bugs, close security vulnerabilities, or improve performance.
