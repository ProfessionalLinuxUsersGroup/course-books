# Unit 8 - Scripting

## Overview

This unit focuses on scripting and system checks in Linux environments, with particular
emphasis on bash scripting for system administration tasks. It covers:

- **Bash Scripting Fundamentals:** Mastery of shell scripting is essential for automating routine
  administrative tasks, implementing monitoring solutions, and creating custom tools that enhance
  system management capabilities.

- **System Monitoring and Checks:** Linux administrators must continuously monitor system health,
  resource utilization, and potential security issues. This unit explores techniques for creating
  scripts that perform automated system checks, gather performance metrics, and alert administrators
  to potential problems.

- **Logical Flow and Decision Making:** The ability to implement complex decision-making logic in scripts
  is crucial for handling various system conditions and scenarios. Students will learn to use conditional
  statements, comparison operators, and truth tables to create intelligent scripts that can adapt to
  different situations.

- **Automation and Scheduled Tasks:** Effective system administration requires automating repetitive tasks
  and scheduling routine maintenance. This unit covers techniques for creating scripts that can be executed
  automatically through cron jobs or systemd timers, reducing manual intervention.

## Learning Objectives

1. **Create and Execute Bash Scripts:**
    - Develop proficiency in writing and executing bash scripts for system administration tasks.
    - Learn to use variables, conditional statements, and loops effectively in scripts.

2. **Apply Logical Structures and Decision Making:**
    - Master the use of if/then/else statements, case statements, and logical operators.
    - Understand truth tables and how they apply to script logic.
    - Learn to implement complex decision trees that handle multiple conditions.

3. **Develop Error Handling and Logging:**
    - Implement robust error detection and handling in scripts.
    - Create comprehensive logging systems that facilitate troubleshooting.
    - Design scripts that can recover from common error conditions.

4. **Analyze and Improve Script Maintainability:**
    - Recognize patterns of poor script design and implement improvements.
    - Organize code with functions and meaningful variable names.
    - Document scripts effectively for future maintenance.
