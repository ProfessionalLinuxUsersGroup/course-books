# Unit 10 - Kubernetes

## Overview

This unit introduces **Kubernetes (K8s)**, an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. The unit covers:

- **Understanding Kubernetes Architecture** - Nodes, Control Plane, and Cluster Components.
- **Installing K3s** - A lightweight Kubernetes distribution optimized for resource efficiency.
- **Interacting with Kubernetes** - Using `kubectl` to manage and troubleshoot clusters.
- **Deploying Applications** - Creating and managing **Pods, Deployments, and Services**.
- **Security and Best Practices** - Implementing security measures and troubleshooting issues.

Kubernetes plays a critical role in **modern enterprise infrastructure**, enabling **scalability, high availability, and automation** in cloud-native applications.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this unit, learners will:

1. **Understand the Core Concepts of Kubernetes:**
    - Define Kubernetes and explain its role in container orchestration.
    - Differentiate between **Kubernetes vs. PaaS (Platform as a Service)**.

2. **Deploy and Manage Kubernetes Clusters:**
    - Install **K3s** and verify its functionality.
    - Manage cluster resources using `kubectl`.

3. **Perform Basic Kubernetes Operations:**
    - Create and manage **Pods, Deployments, and Services**.
    - Understand the role of **Namespaces, ConfigMaps, and Secrets**.

4. **Troubleshoot Kubernetes Clusters:**
    - Identify common cluster issues and validate node status.
    - Diagnose networking and pod scheduling problems.

5. **Apply Security Best Practices in Kubernetes:**
    - Secure containerized applications using best practices.
    - Implement **Kubernetes Pod Security Standards**.
