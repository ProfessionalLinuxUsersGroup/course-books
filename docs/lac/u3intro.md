# Unit 3 - LVM and Raid

## Overview

The unit focuses on understanding and implementing techniques to ensure systems remain operational with minimal downtime.

- The process of quickly assessing, prioritizing, and addressing system incidents.
- Leveraging performance indicators (KPIs, SLIs) and setting clear operational targets (SLOs, SLAs) to guide troubleshooting and recovery efforts.

## Learning Objectives

1. **Understand Fundamental Concepts of System Reliability and High Availability:**
    - Explain the importance of uptime and the implications of “Five 9’s” availability in mission-critical environments.
    - Define key terms such as Single Point of Failure (SPOF), Mean Time to Detect (MTTD), Mean Time to Recover (MTTR), and Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF).

2. **Identify and Apply High Availability Architectures:**
    - Differentiate between Active-Active and Active-Standby configurations and describe their advantages and trade-offs.
    - Evaluate real-world scenarios to determine where redundancy and clustering (using tools like Pacemaker and Corosync) can improve system resilience.

3. **Develop Incident Triage and Response Skills:**
    - Outline a structured approach to incident detection, prioritization, and resolution.
    - Use performance metrics (KPIs, SLIs, SLOs, and SLAs) to guide decision-making during operational incidents.

4. **Integrate Theoretical Knowledge with Practical Application:**
    - Leverage external resources (such as AWS whitepapers, Google SRE documentation, and Red Hat guidelines) to deepen understanding of system reliability best practices.
    - Participate in interactive discussion posts and collaborative problem-solving exercises to reinforce learning.

5. **Cultivate Analytical and Troubleshooting Abilities:**
    - Apply systematic troubleshooting techniques to diagnose and resolve system issues.
    - Reflect on incident case studies and simulated exercises to improve proactive prevention strategies.

These learning objectives are designed to ensure that participants not only grasp the theoretical underpinnings of system reliability and high availability but also build the practical skills needed for effective incident management and system optimization in a professional Linux environment.
