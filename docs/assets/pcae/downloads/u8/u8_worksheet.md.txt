# ProLUG Automation

## Unit 8 Worksheet

## Instructions

Fill out this sheet as you progress through the lab and discussions. Hold your worksheets until
the end to turn them in as a final submission packet.


## Discussion Questions:

### Unit 8 Discussion Post 1
Your infrastructure engineering teams have been experiencing
problems re-creating environments. The main problems have been around reliably building
the exact same environment and also making those builds happen in a timely manner. Last
week you read https://sre.google/sre-book/release-engineering/ and
https://sre.google/workbook/canarying-releases/ to answer the following questions.

1. How is a Kubernetes environment different, in release context from a virtual or
physical server environment?
	a. What does the term ephemeral mean, and are all Kubernetes environments
	ephemeral? Why or why not?
	b. How does blue/green or canary deployments help maintain uptime in release
	management?
		i. What is the use case of each?

### Unit 8 Discussion Post 2
Your team needs to develop a “push button” solution for
deploying Kubernetes for a number of different development teams. You have a
development cluster that they can use and capacity is not a consideration for this
discussion.

1. What pieces of information will you need to supply on your side for this type of
automation?
2. What pieces of information will the team need to supply on their side for each
deployment?
	1. How can the different dev teams feed this into your automation?
		a. What do you prefer?
3. What are some potential default variables you would want to use for this
deployment?

## Definitions/Terminology

### Useful tools


## Lab and Assignment

Unit8 Lab Kubernetes Automation - https://killercoda.com/het-tanis/course/Automation-Labs/Unit8_Kubernetes_Automation

## Digging Deeper

1. Read other use cases for the Kubernetes module in Ansible:
https://docs.ansible.com/projects/ansible/latest/collections/kubernetes/core/k8s_module.html
	1. How might you use these other use cases in your environments?
	2. Do you have another tool you’d use instead of this? Does it have the same, or
	more functionality?
2. Deployment practices with Kubernetes blue/green and canary labs:
	1. https://killercoda.com/het-tanis/course/Kubernetes-Labs/blue-green-deployments
	2. https://killercoda.com/het-tanis/course/Kubernetes-Labs/canary-deployments

## Reflection Questions
1. What questions do you still have about this week?
2. How are you going to use what you’ve learned in your current role?
