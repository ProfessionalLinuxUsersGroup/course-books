below.

ProLUG Lab Setup

cd /root
cp -r /labs/automation/unit3/* /root
chmod 755 /root/*.sh
chmod 755 /root/*.py

Lab

This lab is designed to have the engineer verify and execute their automation tools to interact with the
OS in a controlled fashion.

If you do the killercoda Lab 4, just answer these questions. If you are doing the lab in the ProLUG
environment, find the scripts in `/labs/automation/unit4`.

In the ProLUG lab, you must edit /root/hosts to point at your correct environment based on which “auto<x>” 
server you have connected to.
