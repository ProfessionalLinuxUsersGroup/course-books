Discussion Questions:

Unit 6 Discussion Post 1: Your infrastructure engineering teams have been experiencing
problems re-creating environments. The main problems have been around reliably building
the exact same environment and also making those builds happen in a timely manner.
Read https://sre.google/sre-book/release-engineering/ and
https://sre.google/workbook/canarying-releases/ to answer the following questions.

1. What is release engineering?

2. What are the release engineering principles?

3. How do the tools we’ve discussed this week, Apptainer, Packer, Terraform, or even Ansible fit into these topics?


Unit 6 Discussion Post 2: Your team is trying to decide between the Apptainer and Packer
tools for container deployments. You’ve been tasked with making the decision between the
two packages. Read the following: https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/docs/intro and
https://apptainer.org/docs/user/latest/introduction.html#why-use-apptainer

1. Can you describe apptainer and packer?

2. How would you make the decision between the two of these tools? (You may want to make a table)

    1. What do they both do?
