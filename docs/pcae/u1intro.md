## Learning Objectives

1. Scientific Method
    As engineers we use these six steps as a real/ repeatable practice.
    "Engineering puts the scientific method into repeatable practice."
2. Eight function cycle of operation
    The engineering process explained using an analogy of the firearm cycle of operation.
    "Any deviation from our normal acceptable process is the absolute enemy of engineering."
3. Automation
    Using triggers to start a set of steps in a process.
    "You have to have things work through [specific steps] to completion to complete a cycle.."

    Consistency / repeatability
    Timeliness
6. DevOps Methodology
    Dev is always 'spinning' in a constant cycle.
