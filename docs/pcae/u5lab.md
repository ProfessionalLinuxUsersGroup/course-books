# Unit 5 Lab
## Environment and Local Variables in Systems

This lab is designed to have the engineer verify and execute their automation 
tools to interact with the OS in a controlled fashion.

Follow [this link](https://killercoda.com/het-tanis/course/Automation-Labs/)
and find the lab for Unit 5 to complete it.  

!!! warning

    This lab is designed to be run in the killercoda environment and will take 
    significant user tooling to change over to their own environment. This is not 
    supported in this run of the course but the learner is welcome to work with it 
    and tool it over for that purpose as time permits.
